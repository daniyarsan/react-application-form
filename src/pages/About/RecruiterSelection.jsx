          <h2>SelectingYour Recruiter</h2>
          <p>
            Generally, a recruiter in a healthcare travel agency is assigned to contact you about potential or specific
            travel opportunities. It is the responsibility of the recruiter to guide you through the process of
            exploring opportunities and being your point of contact throughout your interaction with that particular
            agency. The recruiter is the liaison between you and the client healthcare facility as well as between other
            departments within the healthcare travel agency including the credentialing and housing departments. One of
            the advantages of applying with the HealthCare Employment Network is that you will have multiple agencies
            and recruiters from which to choose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the best recruiter is the recruiter who takes the time to build a professional relationship with
            you. You should feel comfortable with your recruiter and believe that your recruiter is truly your advocate
            throughout the process of finding the right assignment as well as continuing that relationship and follow-up
            through the completion of the assignment. If you have concerns that arise during your assignment you should
            feel comfortable that your recruiter will address those concerns and work with you to find a proper
            resolution.

              <h3>Questions You Should Ask When Talking With a Recruiter</h3>
              <p>
                <i className="fa fa-fw fa-check"></i>
                Let the recruiter know that you are considering more than one agency and ask what makes their agency
                different.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i className="fa fa-fw fa-check"></i>
                Ask about their benefit package…especially healthcare benefits. The Affordable Healthcare Act has had an
                impact on what companies have to pay to insure their employees. Many travel agencies now begin coverage
                once the healthcare traveler has been on assignment for 30 days or on the first day of the next month.
                This means you could be without healthcare coverage for a third of your assignment. Ask if they will
                cover your COBRA payment in the interim if this is the case. There are still many agencies that provide
                healthcare coverage from day one.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i className="fa fa-fw fa-check"></i>
                When discussing a specific assignment and facility ask if the travel agency has placed travelers there
                previously and what feedback have they received about the facility.
              </p>
              <p>
                <i className="fa fa-fw fa-check"></i>
                Make sure you understand and are comfortable with the compensation package.

                <i className="fa fa-fw fa-check"></i>
                Ask about shifts on the assignment….are the shifts three 12’s, are the shifts on consecutive days, is
                there “on call” involved, and is there compensation for being “on call.”
              </p>

              <p>
                <i className="fa fa-fw fa-check"></i>
                Ask about the process if the assignment ends early through no fault of your own.
