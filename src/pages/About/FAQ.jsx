                      Absolutely! If You choose to travel with Your family members or pets, most agencies will accommodate Your request, each agency has their own policy, the majority will upgrade Your housing or arrange for Your pet, and however any increase expenditures to the agencies standard package or pet deposits would be Your responsibility. The agencies other option usually offer a housing subsidy, where the agency provides You with a dollar value and You take care of Your own accommodations in lieu of housing. This option is quite profitable for those traveling with a recreational vehicle or that have family or friends in the area. Experiencing new places and the rewards of national travel with a friend, spouse or significant other can make the experience special! Many Healthcare Travelers travel together which also makes it nice, shared expenses, someone that is experiencing everything with You, plus it can get even more profitable for You if You share housing.
